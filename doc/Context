Smart Recipe Finder - Project Context

Overview

Smart Recipe Finder is a web and mobile application that helps users find recipes based on the ingredients they have. The system uses Flask for the backend, React for the frontend, and will later be expanded into a React Native mobile application.

Problem Statement

Many people struggle with deciding what to cook based on available ingredients. This application solves that problem by providing recipe recommendations based on user-inputted ingredients.

Solution

Users enter the ingredients they have.

The app suggests recipes based on those ingredients.

Optional AI-generated unique recipes.

Users can save their favorite recipes.

Additional features like filters, nutrition details, and step-by-step instructions.

Tech Stack

Backend (Python + Flask)

Flask (for REST API)

Spoonacular API (for recipes)

OpenAI API (for AI-generated recipes, optional)

PostgreSQL/MongoDB (for storing user data)

JWT Authentication (for user authentication, optional)

Frontend (React)

React.js (for web UI)

Material UI (or plain CSS for styling)

Axios (for API requests)

Redux (optional for state management)

Mobile App (React Native) - Future Implementation
